# Project DataLad HandBOOK

## Dataset structure

- All inputs (i.e. building blocks from upstream handbook project) are located in
  `src/handbook`.
- The imported laltex sources are in `src/sphinx/`, generated by `make latex`


## Update the print version

All there is to do is ``make UPGRAYEDD``.

This requires an installed submodule ``src/handbook`` that is set up in a way that a ``git pull`` obtains the latest state of the ``print`` branch.

If the local clone is outdated, i.e., changes to upstream and
upstream-processed branches where pushed by others in the meantime, a `make
FORCE-SYNC-ORIGIN` can help to update them. ATTN: This must not be used, when
these branches have unpushed local changes that shall be preserved!!
