The following pages contain a list of URLs for all hyperlinks included in this
book.  A referenced URL like \dlhbhref{D1}{this one}, can be identified by
looking at item \textbf{D1} in this sorted list. Some URLs in this index are
abbreviated.  Abbreviated URLs have identifiers with three characters. The full
URL can be constructed by replacing the \texttt{...} with the URL whose
identifier matches the first two characters of the abbreviated URL's
identifier.  For example, to complete \textbf{B1A}, join it with \textbf{B1}.

Updates to this URL index can be found on this book's companion web page at\\
\url{https://handbook.datalad.org/perma/book-intro-v1.html}.
